          * Tuned non-linear price elasticity models en masse for multiple major US banks, each with 10,000+ model segments, resulting in improved fit in terms of both AIC and RSQ with a significantly higher rate of convergence.
          * Converted local, single threaded legacy modeling process to use SparkR and HDFS pipeline, reducing run time for model fitting by up to 30 times.
          * Installed and managed more than 10,000 price elasticity models per client bank to predict and optimize their acquisition and other balance flows, allowing them to run precise predictions across a wider range of interest rates.
